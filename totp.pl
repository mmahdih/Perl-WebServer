# 2 Factor Authentication Perl code which used the Time-based One-time Password
# Algorithm (TOTP) algorithm.  You can use this code with the Google Authenticator
# mobile app or the Authy mobile or browser app.
# See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm
#
# To get this to work you:
#
# 1) Properly seed the random number generator.
# 2) Use generateBase32Secret(...) to generate a secret key for a user.
# 3) Store the secret key in the database associated with the user account.
# 4) Display the QR image URL returned by qrImageUrl(...) to the user.
# 5) User uses the image to load the secret key into his authenticator application.
#
# Whenever the user logs in:
#
# 1) The user enters the number from the authenticator application into the login form.
# 2) The server compares the user input with the output from generateCurrentNumber(...).
# 3) If they are equal then the user is allowed to log in.
